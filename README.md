## tars Platform modification instructions for PHP

Compared with the default template tar.default, PHP adds tar.tarsphp.default, mainly including the following parts:

```
    <tars>
        ...
        <application>
            <server>
                ...
                php=/data/env/runtime/php-7.1.7/bin/php
                buffer_output_size=12582912
                open_tcp_nodelay=1
                open_eof_check=0
                open_eof_split=0
                task_worker_num=1
                dispatch_mode=2
                daemonize=1
                ...
            </server>
        </application>
        ...
    </tars>
```
* Support custom PHP execution file (/ tar / application / server < PHP >), default / usr / bin / PHP.

* Support the configuration of the startup file of the custom tar s_php framework (/ tar s / application / server < entry >), and the Src / index.php under the default project directory.

* The startup script generated by the tar platform will execute the startup and shutdown script with entrance as the entry file.

In the tar server module, three different HTTP, timer and TCP servers need to use different modules. Please be sure to add and modify new templates!!
